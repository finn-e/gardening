# bitburner

A fun game where you program the game to play itself. Kinda like [Inception](Inception.md), but a video game. And not in the superficial game-within-a-dream sorta way. Something deeper, but less real, too. Spoilers (not really sure how to do them on here) but each bitnode allows you to penetrate deeper into the game, while at the same time taking longer and providing more room for error.
