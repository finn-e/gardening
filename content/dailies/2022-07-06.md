# Daily note for 2022-07-06
A new day, a new note. Woo!
Today Kate's getting her implant, so it's going to be a short day at work for me. I'll finish out my day from home. It's Wednesday, so Doug get's back in two days. I'm excited to have him back, being at work feels pointless without him. Doug my therapist is also back for therapy this Friday. Also good. I get tired of typing slow on my ada layout and end up turning it off. I despair of ever getting back up to my current qwerty speed, even tho that has suffered a bit from all the experimentation.
