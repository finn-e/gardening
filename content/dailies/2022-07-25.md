# Daily note for 2022-07-25

Typing on the ada programmed hillside... a broken qmk with the wrong homerow timing (the basic kind which works imho brokenlyIt's hard to type without typing too fast on the homerow. Or holding for caps. It's just part of the layout. Even when I remember to type a homerow mod shift I try to type it with my pointer... so annoying.

Today I watched [[Inception]]. I should write about it. My game of [[bitburner]] played itself. Worked on the Water Well Search and my Intro to Computing Univ of London course. All things to write about.
