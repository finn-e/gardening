# Daily note for 2022-07-26
Start of a daily note for tomorrow. Having trouble sleeping. Caffeine? Movie? IDK.
Today I will:
- [ ] make serious progress on the ASP version of the water well search.
- [ ] fix one of my keyboards (typing this on JIS laptop. Much better. Having trouble typing k and b, tho. Keep going for ortho spot)
- [ ] finish next weeks Intro hw - check dates on Data Structures
- [ ] start ~~reading~~ skimming the Intro textbook. 

Today I have done none of that. Met with Doug, got the information I need to keep working on the water well search. Have done so, but it doesn't feel like the 'serious progress' I wrote about last night when I couldn't sleep. Also reinstalling linux for the nth time. Or, more specifically, archiving old installations of Arch and Nix to make room to install and test run Neon. Which takes care of itself, but feels Sisyphean. A sort of wind-up bolder rolling itself up the hill.
