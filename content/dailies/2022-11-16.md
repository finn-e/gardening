# Daily note for 2022-11-16
Not much to say. Practicing with my hillside keyboard with the sda layout. September I guess I should call it (the layout). Typing for the fun of typing, or something.
My mother is in town, picked her up at The airpert today. Got there early so I got to watch the planes take off for 45 minutes, which was nice and peaceful. Her plane was slow to land and google said it was already landed when it wasn't. I had htis weird thought like what if she's dead. How will they let me know? How long should I sit there before calling it? &c
Liking typing on real keys. I also typed in SDA for a little while on Kate's ortholinear Nyquist keyboard, which was fun. It's got MX switches on it, and clickys at that (I think they're Kailh Box Jades). So loud...

I need to make my garden more accessible. Right now the only way to browse it is by links, and nothing can be found. Had an update install for Dendron (think Obsidian but as a plugin for VSCode) which reminded me of it and that I still want to try it out. Not that I dislike obsidian and git... they are working out pretty well.

Definitely like choc spacing better than mx spacing for typing. Need to get more combos setup and get a working test keyboard with choc pinks in it. Typing this on whites, which are okay, but not really clicky enough to be worth it as clickys.
