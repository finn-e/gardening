# Daily note for 2022-09-02
This is today. I don't remember starting a note.
Work is going well. Getting ready to head down for Carrie's seminar. 
Typing this on aurum, the current thumbed revision of ada on the kinesis. Not sure if I'll keep the naming, but I doubt it. Running it on my jis laptop, too. I think it's just named ada there, but idk.
